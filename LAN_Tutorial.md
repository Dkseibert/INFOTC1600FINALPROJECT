# How to make a LAN network

**LAN**, which stands for **L**ocal **A**rea **N**etwork, is a wired network of computers within a limited area. LANs are useful for businesses and schools, but can also be used for use in your own home. 


## Step 1: Gather Hardware

Before you can set up your LAN, you will need to acquire **one** of these hardware pieces:

**Router:** A router will automatically assign IP addresses to each device in your LAN, and is necessary to share your internet connection with all connected devices. Even if you don't plan on sharing your internet connection, a router is still recommended. 

**Network Switch:** A network switch accomplishes the same thing as a router for your LAN, as it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, but it will not assign IP addresses and will not share your internet connection. Switches are better used to expand the number of LAN ports available on your network, as they can be connected to your router.

## Step 2: Set up your router

Setting up a router is simple; plug it into a power outlet and place it near your **modem** if you plan on sharing an internet connection on your LAN. Then connect your **router** to your **modem** by wiring your modem to the **WAN/INTERNET** port on your router. If you have a **switch**, connect it to your **router** by plugging an ethernet cable into any **LAN ports** on the router and switch. This will expand the network to the rest of the LAN ports on the switch.

## Step 3: Connect your computers

Use **ethernet cables** to connect each computer to an open **LAN port** on your router or switch. Remember  that ethernet cables struggle to transfer data along cables that are longer than 328ft. If you require a cable longer than 328ft., you can connect a switch between the connections.

## Step 4: Verify network connection

When each computer is assigned an IP address by your router, they'll be able to talk to each other on the network. Once your network is setup, you won't automatically see files from other computers unless that computer has shared files. You can designate files as *shared* so that anyone on the network, or specific computers, can access them. If you are using a switch instead of a router, you will need to setup one of your computers as a **DHCP server**, or **D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol.
